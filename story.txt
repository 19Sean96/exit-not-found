Legend of a vast treasure of {infinite fortune} perpetually lures {treasure seekers} to try and discover it's {location}.
Needless to say, it's never been found.  Unfortunately, you have heard the treasure's {siren's song} and are now on a hunt for it.
As the {lore} goes, there is a {cave} of sorts in which the {treasure} lies.  The first problem is the journey there.  Not only does it
 lie past the [forest] but you must also trek the {towering} [mountains].  The second issue is no one knows the exact location of the {cave}.
Once you get to the [mountains] it's a virtual guessing game as to where the {cave} is.  If you manage to find the {cave} there's {no telling}
what kind of {danger} is {contained} within.  Of course there are {myths} from {all over} throwing out {wild guesses} as to not only what
 the treasure includes but also what you must {battle} to even reach it.  There's only one way to find out and you've decided, unwisely, to
 find out for yourself where and what this {treasure} is.
