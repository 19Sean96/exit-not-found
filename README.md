## Legends Tell...

...of a **VAST** treasure of `{HTTP GET ERR: treasure.type is undefined}` hidden deep in the "Tomb of the Four Hundred Four Kings". While many have attempted to make the journey, no one has came back to tell the tale. 

**This brings us to YOU**...a `{HTTP GET ERR: player.backstory is undefined}` who is still searching for answers as to why `{HTTP GET ERR: player.conflict is undefined}`.

## About

**There's a couple things you should know about this game**

 1. This game was designed & developed for the [2020 js13kGames Competition](https://js13kgames.com/). (This means the entirety of the game must be < 13kb zipped.
 2. This game features procedural generation for creating the levels - meaning each dungeon is randomly generated & tested before being served as a level. 
 3. It is a turn-based RPG-lite dungeon crawler.

## The Future
Later this year, we plan on re-creating this game for mobile. We're excited to see how this game can be extended with the help of a game engine & more flexibility with filesize!
